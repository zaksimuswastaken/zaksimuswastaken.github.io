	<br><h2>PREFACE</h2>
		<p>there aren't any of my own words in here, just some other people's words that make or made me think about the pursuit of acquisition.</p>

	<br><h2>The Parable of the Fisherman and the Investment Banker</h2>
		<blockquote><i>An investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.  Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.  The banker complimented the fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.</blockquote></i>
		<blockquote><i>The fisherman replied, “only a little while. The banker then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The fisherman said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. The banker then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”</p></blockquote></i>
		<blockquote><i>The fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, sleep with my wife, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my friends.  I have a full and busy life.” The banker scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to the city, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”</blockquote></i>
		<blockquote><i>The fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”</blockquote></i>
		<blockquote><i>To which the banker replied, “15 – 20 years.”</blockquote></i>
		<blockquote><i>“But what then?” Asked the fisherman.</blockquote></i>
		<blockquote><i>The banker laughed and said, “That’s the best part.  When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”</blockquote></i>
		<blockquote><i>“Millions – then what?”</blockquote></i>
		<blockquote><i>The banker said, “Then you would retire.  Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, sleep with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your friends.”</blockquote></i>
