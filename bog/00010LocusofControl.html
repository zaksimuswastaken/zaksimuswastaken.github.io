	<h2>The Big Five as a Thought Hazard</h2>
		<img src="00010BigFive.png", height="250">
		<p>I don't really know how much merit there is to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits">Big Five personality traits</a>. Genuinely, I have never looked into it's validity. I have no opinion on its scientific rigour or validity or whatever. But I feel like <mark>our awareness of this pyschological model contributes to the abandonment of people's locus of control</mark>.</p>
		<p>Being fatalistic about the unchangeability or intrinsicness of your personality is really horrible for your development. Most of the big five traits are bad in both excess and deficiency, and desirable in moderation. <mark>This shit should never have been looked at like a personality test or astrology or something. It should be an introspective tool, for identifying areas of your personality that you want to mold or develop or improve or dial down or whatever.</mark> Doing something like giving up your free will because "welp i'm just an introvert and so i am destined to be uncharismatic and socially awkward" feels like an actually hazardous mindset to have, and so I wonder if it's a bad idea to introduce these kinds of models to people if it leads to these kinds of thoughts developing.</p>
		<ul>
			<br><li><b><i>Openness:</i></b> Being curious, creative and open to new ideas is great. But this needs to be tempered at times with a certain level of down-to-earth, uncreative appreciation of what we already know works.</li>
			<br><li><b><i>Conscientiousness:</i></b> Being disciplined, dutiful, organized and prepared is great. So is retaining a good level of flexibility and spontaneity.</li>
			<br><li><b><i>Extraversion:</i></b> I think you will struggle in this life if you are too social-setting-averse, and you should really want to avoid being shy. However, you should also have the ability to be content on your own, and have a good level of independence from external sources of stimulation.</li>
			<br><li><b><i>Agreeableness:</i></b> I think it's good to value getting along with others. I also think it's good to not be too attached to the concerns of others. Taking too much time for others will leave you with no time for yourself.</li>
			<br><li><b><i>Neuroticism:</i></b> I don't think that experiencing especially strong negative emotions is bad. I think if something bad happens, it makes sense to feel bad. If something horrible happens, it makes sense to feel horrible, and it's probably good to feel horrible when horrible things happen. I think a lack of emotional attachment to the stakes in your life leads to apathy.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><mark>When someone tells me "I can't socialize, I'm an introvert" I get the same feeling as I do when someone tells me "I can't plan, I'm an Aries".</mark> Sure, one of these statements is in the genre of psychology, which is generally accepted as a legitimate field of study, and the other one is in the genre of astrology, which is generally accepted as having no basis in reality, but that doesn't matter here. They feel the same because both statements are demonstrative of the speaker surrendering their locus of control - to their intrinsic personality, or to their zodiac sign.</p>
	
	
	<br><h2>Free Will Does (not) Exist</h2>
		<img src="00010UnderrailLocusofControl.png", height="250">
		<figcaption>From <i>Underrail</i>, by Stygian Software</figcaption>
		<p>Is free will real, or is everything predetermined?</p>
		<p>I don't fucking know man. But here's what I do know - believing free will is real, or at least believing that you believe that free will is real - is very good for your mental. You really ought to believe that your destiny is controlled in some significant part by you. You really should believe, or at least try to believe, that you are in control (at least in part, probably a large part) of your destiny, that you are responsible for your actions. You should claim your achievements, not just your failures, as your own, and not solely place the blame for your achievements (and failures) on your environment or luck or karma or the teacher liking you or hating you or the global elite or microplastics in your brain.</p>
		<p>And you really should believe that you are in control of your own brain, your personality, your behaviours. Choose to be the kind of person that you know you can be, to the best of your ability. Maybe some of your personality is genetic or too environmentally ingrained to be changed on any time span that you can imagine. But at least believe that some of it isn't, and do your best with the part you can control. You can always do your best.</p>
		<br><blockquote><i>
Out of the night that covers me,<br>
      &emsp;Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>
I thank whatever gods may be<br>
      &emsp;For my unconquerable soul.<br>

In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
      &emsp;I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
      &emsp;My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br>

Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
      &emsp;Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>
And yet the menace of the years<br>
      &emsp;Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br>

It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
      &emsp;How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
<mark>I am the master of my fate,</mark><br>
      &emsp;<mark>I am the captain of my soul.<br></mark>
