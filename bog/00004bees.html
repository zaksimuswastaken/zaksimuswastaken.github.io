		<p>I think about this exchange sometimes. Sometimes I wish humans had telepathy, not even for the sake of communicating across large distances or anything like that (we have phones nowadays), but for communicating complicated concepts for which words are failing me, using just my mind and ideas.</p>
		<p>People laud foreign languages for having words that don't 1:1 translate to English, because the word describes a concept for which English does not have a single word for. Particularly for German, with it's compound words, which, in reality, are not all that different from an ordinary sentence.</p>
		<p>It doesn't exactly matter that English does not have a 'word' for "there are bees here lets leave immediately", while elephants do. Human languages are generally advanced enough that such words don't need to exist (though they may exist, and may offer some utility). From what I hear, Russians don't have a word for "thirsty", instead they say "I want water", but they get by just fine without that word.).</p>
		<p>I guess really what I want is the communication abilities that come from being able to communicate your ideas masterfully via language, but without needing mastery of language. Mastering things is hard.</p>
