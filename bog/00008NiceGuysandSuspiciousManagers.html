	<h2>The Suspicious Manager</h2>
		<p>The other day I was approached by my manager, they gave me a nice thank you card and a $20 Starbucks gift card. "How nice of them" I thought. Then they told me about all the benefits that the company would offer me if I did a more advanced position for them.</p>
		<p>How did that make me feel? You know, like they were trying to soften me up in order to get something from me. Obviously.</p>
		<p>As nice as their gesture was, it was very easy for me to tell that it wasn't just coming from the kindness of their heart. They weren't really just thanking me for a job well done. They were thanking me because they wanted me to have a better impression regarding a certain career opportunity. One that they would benefit from me taking.</p>
		
		
	<br><h2>Nice Guys</h2>
		<p>I think this is very similar to what drives the "nice guy" phenomenon. People don't like it when they feel like you're being ungenuinely nice. <mark>People love genuinely kind people. And genuinely kind people tend to do nice things. But you can do nice things to trick people into thinking you are a kind person. And people hate that.</mark></p>
		
		
	<br><h2>Advice for Nice Guys and Suspicious Managers</h2>
		<p>Don't go into interactions with people with the intention of trying to convince them of things. If your offer is good, it will speak for itself. Just be a genuinely kind person, and people will like you.</p>
