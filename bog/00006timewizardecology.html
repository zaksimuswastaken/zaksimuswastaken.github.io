	<h2>On Banning Game Pieces</h2>
		<p>Banning specific combinations of game elements is always tricky the two competitive genres i can think of where this is a seriously relevant and common problem are card games as a whole, and competitive pokemon.</p>
		
		
	<br><h2>The Magic Example</h2>
		<p>Here's an ancient and broken as shit example:</p>
			<img src="00006timevault.jpg" width="250">
		<p>this is an <b>artifact</b> that lets you <b>get another turn</b> but it <b>can only be used once unless you skip a turn to reactivate it</b></p>
			<img src="00006voltaickey.jpg" width="250">
		<p>this card lets you cheaply <b>reactivate an artifact</b></p>
		<p>in combination this creates an infinite amount of turns, and generally wins you the game immediately.</p>
		<p>the problem is that <mark>seperately, the elements are fine</mark>, but <mark>the combination is too centralizing</mark>, because by allowing this strategy to exist, it <mark>reduces the space of viable strategies</mark>. the only real strategies are now "get an infinite amount of turns on turn 3, or play something that wins EVEN FASTER than that"</p>
		<p>now some people might like a game where the goal is to just get two specific cards as quickly as possible and win the game in like three turns. but most people like the idea of this game having a more diverse set of strategies that can be used. the player fantasy for magic the gathering is that you are a wizard, your opponent is a wizard, and you are casting spells from your memory, represented by your deck. one day you fight a fire wizard. the next day you fight a guy who summons a bunch of angels. but this combo makes it so that everyone must become a time vault wizard or die.</p>
		
	<br><h2>but this is hard lol</h2>
		<p>when you're banning like combinations of elements though, it's kinda hard to decide like, how to ban it. like if i'm just playing with my friends I can just go ""hey this time vault shit seems fucking retarded i'm not going to make Alice and Bob play against this". and that works fine for groups of friends (it actually works really well for things like dnd), but if i'm in a competitive environment - if we're playing to win, then hell no. I'm going to go ahead and annihilate you with the strongest strategy possible.</p>
		<p>and so as funny as the meme of <a href="https://gist.github.com/gpluscb/240e6df82c59e9f153a16167d4a729e8">"in 20XX everyone plays Fox perfectly and games are decided by rock paper scissors for port priority"</a> is, sometimes you really should ban something so that you don't just end up with time wizards and nothing else</p>
		<p>Or you could just say <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/gs/pokemon/snorlax/">"nah, if you don't want to be a time wizard, this is the wrong game. perish."</a></p>
