	<h2>Heads Up!</h2>
		<p>If you don't play fighting games, this bogpost will probably be difficult to follow. I explain a lot of basic things, but inevitably, I am writing this as someone who has probably played too many of these games to really appreciate what this all looks like from an outsider's perspective. Also I swear the genre isn't as complicated as this bogpost probably makes it out to be.</p>
	
	
	<h2>Preface</h2>
		<p>First, this bogpost is about my framework for learning, in general. I've picked an obscure topic as my example - the combo theory of the character I play in a less-than-mainstream fighting game. It makes for a topic that very few people will already be familiar with, so you can probably experience learning the concept as you follow this bogpost. <mark>The fighting game being looked at here is not the important part though. You could apply this <b>learning framework</b> to literally any fighting game, and really any skill.</mark></p>
		<p>Second, I'm not an expert on this character, this game, or fighting games in general. What you're about to read is me stumbling my way through learning this character's combo theory, so that should go without saying, but I'm saying it explicitly to emphasize.</p>
		<p>Third, I don't break EVERYTHING I EVER LEARN down into this much detail. I wish I had the mental bandwidth to do so, but <a href="00003believingindeath.html">in life, one must prioritize</a>. That being said, this learning philosophy does colour how I subconsciously learn things that I don't dedicate deliberate effort to learning, so it's not as though this framework only comes into play when I sit and break everything down.</p>
		<p>Finally, I'm not pretending to say this is the right or optimal or only way to learn things. This is just my conceptualization.</p>
	
	
	<br>
	<h2>People Who Are Good at Everything</h2>
		<p>You ever meet someone who just seems to be good at literally everything they do? You know, when you go to your high school graduation, and they announce how the valedictorian has a 98% average in all his classes, was on the wrestling team, the chess team, the debate club, played trumpet in band, had a supporting role in the school play, works an internship at a law firm, developed a dating sim that won some game jam, got his short story published in the local newspaper, volunteers at an orphanage, and has TWO hot boyfriends... and it makes you go "damn. i kinda just suck"? How did that guy get so good at everything?</p>
		<p>Well first of all, let me acknowledge that yes, some people are probably possess specific innate talents, and some people might be gifted in aspects (like IQ) that help them be competent at a lot of things even. But that seems to be beyond our control, so we'll move on from that.</p>
		<p>Second, I will say that yes, some people have access to better resources or more time. Sometimes this is just a matter of them proritizing different activities, sometimes it's a matter of work ethic, and sometimes money buys the best tutors â€” but it's not healthy to dwell on that if you don't have said money.</p>
		<p>The third reason I think some people seem to be good at everything is that they have an aptitiude for learning. This could be another innate aptitude, but in my experience, learning how to learn seems to be a skill that can be... learned. I certainly feel as though I got better at learning things the more things I tried to learn.</p>
		<p>Finally, I don't think most people who seem to be good at everything are actually GOOD at everything. They're just competent at everything (still impressive, mind you). Which leads me to...</p>

	<h2>The Pareto Principle</h2>
		<blockquote><i>In 1941, Joseph M. Juran, a Romanian-born American engineer, came across the work of Italian polymath Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto noted that approximately 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. <mark>Juran applied the observation that 80% of an issue is caused by 20% of the causes to quality issues.</mark> Later during his career, Juran preferred to describe this as "the vital few and the useful many" to highlight that the contribution of the remaining 80% should not be discarded entirely.</i></blockquote>
		<blockquote>- From Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#History"><i>History</i> section on the <i>"Pareto Principle"</i> page</a></blockquote>
		<p>The Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, is the idea that 20% of your input results in 80% of your outcomes.</p>
		<p>I would argue that most people who appear to be good at everything have just put that 20% of effort required for 80% of the gains into a lot of different things. It is not common for athletes to be professionally competitive in multiple sports, or experts in multiple fields of study. When that does happen, it usually happens in domains that are closely related to one another.</p>

		<figcaption>Michael Phelps would absolutely kick my ass at water polo, but even this once-in-a-lifetime talent was not an olympic water poloist.</figcaption>
		<p>The trouble with the 80/20 rule when it comes to learning is that it might not be immediately clear <b>which 20%</b> is going to give you 80% of the results.</p>
		<p>To figure that out, I have two main approaches. The first, is to seek the wisdom of those who came before me. The second, is to dig straight to bedrock and piece the logic of the thing myself.</p>
		<p>These aren't exactly two separate modes, and in this example, I'm going to use a few resources to guide my fundamental understandings, and in turn my fundamental understandings will help me fully exploit certain resources.</p>

	<h2>Hierarchies of Emergence</h2>
		<p>To be brief, this XKCD comic comes to mind whenever I'm thinking of "fundamental concepts":</p>
		<br><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/purity.png", height="250">
		<p>Borp calls this kind of pattern a <a href="https://philosophicaltreasures.com/hierarchies-of-emergence/">hierarchy of emergence</a>, and I'm happy to name it the same thing. My approach to learning follows a hierarchy of emergence.</p>
		
	
	<br>
	<h2>Starting with the Fundamentals - Math and Formal Logic</h2>
		<p>So. Here's our game:</p>
		<br><img src="", height="250">
		<p>To fundamentally understand how we can perform combos, we have to first understand how the natural laws of this game's universe</p>
		<p>You can consider each move in the game to have three parts - startup, active, recovery</p>
		<br>VIDEO
		<p>The guy getting hit is stunned when he gets hit here, so we say that he is in a state called hitstun.</p>
		<p>To combo, we have to use a move that finishes starting up before the other guy can finish recovering from hitstun.</p>
		<br>VIDEO
		<p>In most fighting games, there are two ways to accomplish this:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>First, by just using a move that has a shorter startup than however much hitstun another move inflicts. This is called a <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Link">LINK</a></li>
			INFIL VIDEO
			<li>Second, by cheating and just getting rid of the recovery of our first attack, so we can go straight into our second attack. This is called a <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Cancel">CANCEL</a></li>
			INFIL VIDEO
		<ul>
		<p>Great. Since I only care to explore combo theory here, I don't need to worry about the rest of the game. I only care about what moves can go into what other moves for the moment. I have solved all the laws of the universe that are relevant here.</p>
		<p>Now first things first, I need to know the moves I have available, so I can find out which moves can LINK and CANCEL into each other. Well, <a href="https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Under_Night_In-Birth/UNI2/Eltnum#Normal_Moves">the community wiki has a handy dandy movelist</a> for me, so let's check it out.</p>
		<br>VIDEO
		<p>In theory, the very first step, if I wanted to be completely 100% thorough would be to go through EVERY SINGLE MOVE and test which moves combo into each other. In a fighting game, you would do this by checking the startup of some move A and comparing it to the hitstun some other move B, to see if you would have enough time to combo in move A before your opponent can recover from move B. Then you would check to see which moves have <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Recovery">recovery</a> that you can cancel out of.</p>
		<p><mark>that would be fucking insane</mark></p>
		<p>If you play UNISC's tutorial, you quickly learn that the game is not very focused on LINKs, and that the general rules for what cancels into each other are generally fairly straightforward:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Normal attacks can be cancelled into each other in literally any order (<a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Reverse%20Beat">reverse beat</a>). However, once you use a given move in a combo, it can no longer be cancelled into - with the exception of crouching light attacks, for some reason.</li>
			<li>You can cancel basically all grounded normals into a jump</li>
			<li>You can cancel any normal, grounded or aerial, into a special</li>
			<li>You can cancel any special that doesn't use meter into a special or super that does use meter</li>
			<li>You can cancel anything into <a href="https://glossary.infil.net/?t=Chain%20Shift">Chain Shift</a>, which you can think of for the purposes of combo theory as being a move that takes up only 1 frame and does no damage - it's usefulness here is mainly that it can be cancelled into from anything.<li>
		</ul>
		<p>Awesome now we know the fundamental laws of the universe, and the fundamental laws of (most of) our character's moveset. By the way, this was an example of saving a lot of fucking time by using an external resource - the tutorial, in this case. The way I arrived to the fundamental rules of the universe earlier was also an example of this - I used my already-existing understanding of fighting games. Using the wiki's movelist instead of trying every move out myself was another instance of this.</p>
		<p>Now that we know the rules, let's go ahead and apply them to make some combos.</p>
