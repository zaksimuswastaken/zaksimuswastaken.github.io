	<h2>On Beasts</h2>
		DUNE QUOTE
		<p>Dune is an interesting novel, one of my favourites. Much of the sci-fi I've read tackles Man vs. Machine as one of it's primary concerns - the classic cyberpunk conundrum of from whence humanity comes from. In the world of Dune, Man vs. Machine is done. There was a huge galaxy-spanning jihad, and now computers are illegal. No AI, no robots, hell no calculators. There are special people who are on something like space amphetamines that, combined with extensive training, lets them act as human computers. You can't pilot a spaceship at planet-hopping speeds without being on this stuff - no piloting computers - nothing.</p>
		<p> Dune instead concerns itself with Man vs. Beast. If Blade Runner asks what separates the intelligent race of man from sufficiently intelligent A.I., then Dune asks what separates what separates instinct-driven animals from sufficiently instinctual humans.</p>
		<p>The primary antagonist so-to-speak is a gluttonous, lustful, slothful ball of a man - the book describes him as being so obese that he needs to hover around using this hover chair.</p>
		<p>The protagonists of dune are portrayed by constrast as being very
		A man chooses using reason, a slave obeys programming.

	<br><h2>On Growth</h2>
		<blockquote><i>To embrace perfection is to sacrifice growth.</i></blockquote>
		<blockquote>- I don't know who to attribute this to. I first saw it <a href="https://tl.net/forum/starcraft-2/377719-what-do-you-play-a-simple-poll">on the TeamLiquid forums, where it was Destiny's forum quote</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-YTiYahYc0&t=1035s">he seems to have mentioned offhand that it might have been attributed to Nietzche (this video is insane btw)</a>, but I have no evidence towards this attribution, and Google is not helping me, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.</blockquote>

		<blockquote><i>Train up a child in the way he should go, And even when he is old he will not depart from it.</i></blockquote>

	<br><h2>A Mind Made Up</h2>
		<p>PARAGRAPH</p>
		<blockquote>RHETORIC: <i>Hear that? That's the sound of meaninglessness. <mark>Meaning, ideas, theory -- all that has evaporated. Now there is only dry silence -- the sound of a mind made up.</mark> Just like four billion others. I am so sorry.</i></blockquote>
