	<h2>God is Dead</h2>
		<blockquote><i>God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him.</i></blockquote>
		<blockquote><i>"How shall we comfort ourselves. the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement. what sacred games shall we have to invent? <mark>Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?</mark></i></blockquote>
		<blockquote>- Friedrich Nietzsche, <i><a href="../archivedstuff/referencedworks/books/Nietzsche_TheGayScience.htm">The Gay Science</a></i></blockquote>
		<p>Everyone knows this one. Not everyone knows what Nietzsche meant by this, and I guess not everyone agrees either, but here's my understanding:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>God is dead - god as the guiding axiom for morality and meaning for humanity is no longer viable for most people.</li>
			<li>God remains dead. He has lost the allure He once had, and this is not a phase, but a turning point for humanity.</li>
			<li>And we have killed him, using advancements in science and philosophy which forced people to question many religious beliefs, and often abandon them entirely. Things like the heliocentric model and the general advancement of cosmology, the pioneers of germ theory, and the theory of evolution, which Darwin had published just a couple decades after Nietzsche's birth.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The next few sentences are more interesting to me. Must we ourselves become gods to be worthy of having killed god?</p>
		<p>Nietzsche was probably talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Cbermensch">Übermensch</a> here.</p>

		<p>EXPLANATION</p>
		<p>SEMI-REJECTION</p>
	
	
	<br><h2>The Merits of Resurrecting Satan</h2>
		<p>I think god's death has left a god-shaped hole in the fabric of society, that people are really desperate to patch up. For evidence towards this, I would point towards the many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_religion_and_science#Integration">rewritings or reinterpretations of holy texts in order to make them fit alongside the god-killing ideas</a>, and the phenomenon of rather <a href="https://twitter.com/Raaaatiba/status/1586293661360193537?lang=en">large internet communities gathering around the idea of religion</a>, even if they <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/andrew-tate-partnered-in-casinos-with-alleged-romanian-organized-crime-figures">don't seem to live by it's principles</a>.</p>
		<p>Nietzsche thought the same. He pointed to communism as being an example of people looking for God in the state. Indeed, I have met modern communists to whom communism seems to fill the void of religion. It's a grand idea that gives you a community of people with whom you have something in common (ideology, instead of religion), and it gives you direction for your life. For many people, I think it's a secular means to the same end that religion might have served historically.</p>
		<p>I use communism as an example here, because Nietzsche did, but it goes without saying that I believe I have observed this kind of god-resurrecting phenomenon with many political ideologies (from communism to libertarianism to the alt-right to centrism), or grand ideas in general (from AI singularity to effective altruism to incels to atheism <span style="font-size: 50%">(ironically)</span>).</p>
		<p>To be completely 100% clear, I am <mark>NOT CRITICIZING</mark> this behaviour, and I propose harnessing this seemingly deep-rooted desire for religion.</p>
		<p>People seem to really want to resurrect god. There's a lot of different ideas on which god we should resurrect, and there's plenty of people who believe that we're better off not resurrecting any god, but I think I have a solution amenable to those people too.</p>
		<p>There was once a time where the Greeks were able to incorporate all the different gods around them into a polytheistic religion, but that's not an approach that would work in our world. There are at least three religions off of the top of my head that allow for no other gods before the one true god. </p>
		<p>As in the communism example, I think the way to go is a secular approach.</p>
		<p>INDEPENDENCE DAY CLIP</p>
		<p><mark>The greatest uniting force seems to be an adversary</mark>. So let everyone pick whatever god(s) they want. Let's resurrect Satan.</p>
		
		
	<br><h2>Moloch</h2>
		<p>I highly recommend reading Scott Alexander's blogpost <a href="https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/">Meditations on Moloch</a>. It's beautiful. For people who don't want to read all of that, but would heed my recommendation if it was in an audio format, I recommend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fifVuhgvQQ8">Christian G's narration</a>.</p>
		<p>If you won't read or listen to that blogpost (it is pretty long, but I really do think it's worth it), the best summary I can give to you is that Moloch is the demon of zero-sum thinking leading to bad outcomes for all parties involved. Moloch is the force behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma">prisoner's dilemma</a>, behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arms_race">arms races</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem">free-rider problem</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom">races to the bottom</a>.</p>
		<blockquote><i>A basic principle unites all of the multipolar traps above. <mark>In some competition optimizing for X, the opportunity arises to throw some other value under the bus for improved X. Those who take it prosper. Those who don’t take it die out. Eventually, everyone’s relative status is about the same as before, but everyone’s absolute status is worse than before.</mark> The process continues until all other values that can be traded off have been – in other words, until human ingenuity cannot possibly figure out a way to make things any worse.</i></blockquote>

	<br><h2>Win-Win</h2>
		<p>PRISONERS DILEMMA, CONTRAST WIN-WIN AND LOSE-LOSE CORNERS</p>
		<p>In her podcast, Liv Boeree calls this force literally <i>"<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LivBoeree/videos">Win-Win</a>"</i>, and while part of me wants a grander name for it, win-win is literally what it comes down to, and the name fully explains what is meant, so it's a pretty good name and I'm happy to just call it win-win.</p>
		<p>SOMETHING</p>
		<p>The best systems seem to be those that harness mankind's drive to compete for good:
		<ul>
			<li>The greatest war so far fought by mankind was also one of the greatest periods of time for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_during_World_War_II">technological advancements</a>.</li>
			<li>For capitalism's many great faults, free markets are probably the only system of goods allocation that could theoretically be considered <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pareto-efficiency.asp">Pareto efficient</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The problem is that our drive to compete frequently fuels mutually harmful contests.</p>
